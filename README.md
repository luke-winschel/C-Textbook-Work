* Exercise 1: Sum of Two Numbers
    Write a program that stores the integers 50 and 100 in variables, and stores the sum of
    these two in a variable named total.

* Exercise 2: Sales Prediction
    The East Coast sales division of a company generates 58 percent of total sales. Based
    on that percentage, write a program that will predict how much the East Coast division
    will generate if the company has $8.6 million in sales this year.

* Exercise 8: Total Purchase
    A customer in a store is purchasing five items. The prices of the five items are
    Price of item 1 = $15.95
    Price of item 2 = $24.95
    Price of item 3 = $6.95
    Price of item 4 = $12.95
    Price of item 5 = $3.95
    Write a program that holds the prices of the five items in five variables. Display each
    item’s price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume the
    sales tax is 7%.

* Exercise 1: Miles per Gallon
    Write a program that calculates a car’s gas mileage. The program should ask the user
    to enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can
    be driven on a full tank. It should then display the number of miles that may be driven
    per gallon of gas.

* Exercise 4: Average Rainfall
    Write a program that calculates the average rainfall for three months. The program
    should ask the user to enter the name of each month, such as June or July, and the
    amount of rain (in inches) that fell each month. The program should display a message
    similar to the following:
    The average rainfall for June, July, and August is 6.72 inches.

* Exercise 11:Automobile Costs
    Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following
    expenses incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas,
    oil, tires, and maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of
    these expenses, and the total annual cost of these expenses.

* Exercise 4: Areas of Rectangles
    The area of a rectangle is the rectangle’s length times its width. Write a program that
    asks for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which
    rectangle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same.

* Exercise 13: Book Club Points
    Serendipity Booksellers has a book club that awards points to its customers based on
    the number of books purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:
    • If a customer purchases 0 books, he or she earns 0 points.
    • If a customer purchases 1 book, he or she earns 5 points.
    • If a customer purchases 2 books, he or she earns 15 points.
    • If a customer purchases 3 books, he or she earns 30 points.
    • If a customer purchases 4 or more books, he or she earns 60 points.
    Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books that he or she has
    purchased this month and then displays the number of points awarded.
    
* Exercise 23: Geometry Calculator
    Write a program that displays the following menu:
    Geometry Calculator
      1. Calculate the Area of a Circle
      2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
      3. Calculate the Area of a Triangle
      4. Quit
      Enter your choice (1-4):
    If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display
    its area. Use the following formula:
    area π r 2
    Use 3.14159 for π and the radius of the circle for r . If the user enters 2, the program
    should ask for the length and width of the rectangle and then display the rectangle’s
    area. Use the following formula:
    area = length * width
    If the user enters 3 the program should ask for the length of the triangle’s base and its
    height, and then display its area. Use the following formula:
    area = base * height * .5
    If the user enters 4, the program should end.
    Input Validation: Display an error message if the user enters a number outside the range
    of 1 through 4 when selecting an item from the menu. Do not accept negative values
    for the circle’s radius, the rectangle’s length or width, or the triangle’s base or height.
